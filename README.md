# SDU Gesture Dataset

As was announced in the morning, we at the Welfare Robotics Team at SDU are recording a dataset for recognition of actions and gestures for human robot interaction.
The dataset will be publicly available, but only for research purposes. The recordings take 60-80 minutes. If you want to help by being recorded, you can schedule a time in the calendar below or let me know personally.
